                The key challenge in manufacturing is to balance between increasing and complex demands from customers while carefully consuming the limited natural resources. The fourth industrial revolution is shaping enterprises, tools, and long-term smart manufacturing strategies. Internet of Things (IOT) is the turning point for the traditional approaches by helping the integration between forefront systems (Alcácer & Cruz-Machado, 2019). Digitalization is not only affecting the firms but the competition as well. Due to increasing customization demand and complexity of the products and production; product development times are shortened with higher cost cuts (Kohn & Harborth, 2018; Quandt et al., 2018; Zigart & Schlund, 2020). To stay strong and exist in this competing race, all firms but especially the industrial companies need to be more efficient and effective in the way they work. Augmented Reality (AR) is one of the key components which helps enterprises to become more efficient and effective (Brunner et al., 2020; Sony & Naik, 2019; Uva et al., 2018). AR is a key enabling technology of Industry 4.0 and nominated as the main technology by the European Union (De Amicis et al., 2018; Egger & Masood, 2020). Based on a forecast done by IDC group, the revenue is expected to be around $162 billion by 2020 (Brunner et al., 2020). Perhaps among many other areas, the manufacturing domain is the most critical field. In which the AR could improve the current state dramatically (Plakas et al., 2020; Zigart & Schlund, 2020). It is a smart and novel interface for interacting with people in the world of smart factories (Egger & Masood, 2020). As manufacturing becomes complex, the need for experienced workers increases. However, one of the struggles for the firms is to find such talented individuals or to train them in-house (Lai et al., 2020). AR is providing the required information inventively to employees. As a consequence, the employee easily understands complex processes such as maintenance manuals. By providing intuitive illustrated content and real-time feedback, human errors are reduced as well as the costs of such operations (Ceruti et al., 2019; Elia et al., 2016).AR is a technology that integrates the physical world we are living with the virtual world we are experiencing in a single display (Speicher et al., 2019; Zigart & Schlund, 2020). The virtual world is computer-generated information such as video, sound, 3D CAD (computer-aided design) models and markers (Amin & Govilkar, 2015; Aydin, 2018; Berryman, 2012; Chi et al., 2013; Plakas et al., 2020). Superimposing virtually created content in the real life is firstly introduced by Azuma and Malibu (Azuma & Malibu, 1997) and affecting our lives daily (Chi et al., 2013). Besides the term AR, there are other very similar and common names such as Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality. The taxonomy can be confusing for many people. In many instances, the AR and VR terminologies are used wrongly. The detailed interviews with AR/VR experts prove that there is no common under-standing v(Speicher et al., 2019). The Figure 1, created by Milgram and Kishino explains the taxonomy perfectly (Milgram & Kishino, 1994).

            In order to clarify the virtual and real environments in the Figure 1, the modeling diagram can be used. Figure 2, is demonstrating superimposition taxonomy with a different perspective (Milgram & Kishino, 1994).Using AR in manufacturing offers various benefits. The complexity of products and increasing variants cause assembly operations to become convoluted. The learning curve for shop floor people is certainly steeper than it used to be. Moreover, the operators are required to have real- time information and instructions to do their jobs. The corrective action suggested by AR systems is reducing errors or avoiding mistakes before they could occur (Egger & Masood, 2020). There are various manufacturing pilot projects. These projects provide quicker production, higher quality, and more efficient maintenance operations by naturally merging virtual and real objects (Arbeláez- Estrada & Osorio- Gómez, 2013; Caricato et al., 2014; Elia et al., 2016; Ivaschenko et al., 2018). As the complexity of operation increases, the benefit of using an AR system inflates (Zigart & Schlund, 2020). Oftentimes, the traditional, paper-based operation manuals cannot clearly explain the procedures (Ceruti et al., 2019). AR provides an intuitive teaching method that allows learning by doing the tasks (Bower et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016).Among many benefits that are discussed earlier, AR systems are still far away from perfection. However, they are becoming more and more mature with the advancements in the hardware and software technologies (Elia et al., 2016). The promising future of AR is expected to be so advanced that observers would not distinguish between what is augmented and what is real (Amin & Govilkar, 2015). Besides the technical challenges, perhaps the most crucial aspect of complex IT system evaluation lies in the decision problem (Caricato et al., 2014). Moreover, technical aspects need to be integrated with organizational technology adaption. Organizational challenges, require-ments, and strategies need to be mapped with the selected solution capabilities to utilize the new tool (Bueno Espíndola et al., 2013). It is very difficult to find a systematic way of evaluating such systems in terms of beneficial measures relative to their cost and return on the investment (Caricato et al., 2014)

            To guide the organizations to select the best AR application that is aligned with their strategies and needs; the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach is provided as a guideline. The detailed AR features are identified by extended research reviews. The most important features are explained in detail. Organizations that require AR solutions could potentially apply the suggested framework on the defined criteria list and pick the best alternative. The article aims to contribute to the literature in two ways:– A detailed literature investigation and explanation of AR capabilities would enable a better understanding of the technology – The novel Spherical Fuzzy (SF) COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) MCDM model named SF-COPRAS eliminates subjective judgment for individuals. Therefore, it helps orga-nizations to determine the best possible AR solution selection based on actual needs and requirements The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the literature review for AR and fuzzy MCDM methods. Section 3 provides a detailed overview of the AR challenges, reasons to use AR, and AR use-cases. Subsection 3.4 explains the most important AR application features considered for MCDM. Section 4, explains the methodology step by step followed by Section 5, an illustrative example of the method. Followed by discussing the result of the outcomes in Section 6. Lastly, Section 7 demonstrate the sensitivity analysis followed by Section 8, future work sugges-tions and concluding remarks.

            2.Literature review This section deliberates the literature review about AR and fuzzy MCDM methods focused on SF numbers (SFN).2.1.Augmented realityAR as a research area is rapidly growing with many published papers (Zigart & Schlund, 2020). To correctly understand how the AR is used in different sectors; various AR use cases, reviews, and technical papers were investigated. The focus was on the last decades’ researches to provide the most up-to-date information. Some review papers provide extensive metrics on how the papers are categorized. In the broad overview of AR papers, Bottani and Vignali suggest that the most common AR use cases are assembly and maintenance operations. Almost one-third of all inves-tigated papers focus on these use cases. If the other fields such as training/learning, design, safety instructions, and expert guidance are added; more than half of the papers will be relevant to the manufacturing industry (Bottani & Vignali, 2019). Among the provided applications, the most important benefits are time reduction and quality improvement. According to the research done by Kohn and Harborth some companies reduce the time of operations by 80%. The reduction in errors is increased to 96% (Kohn & Harborth, 2018). As interesting as it gets, these high numbers are not reflecting the average. According to other studies, time reduction generally lies between 10% and 30% in average (Egger & Masood, 2020; Lai et al., 2020; Uva et al., 2018; Zigart & Schlund, 2020).Besides the benefits obtained in manufacturing, many other papers focus on the challenges of implementing AR solutions (Egger & Masood, 2020). For managers and stakeholders to analyze AR application requirements, there are only a few papers in the literature (Caricato et al., 2014). Each paper analyses AR in terms of a single use-case. However, to verify the company-wide ROI, a thorough analysis of such systems is required (Elia et al., 2016). For the majority of people, AR is all about devices that one wears to experience superimposed virtual objects. By all means, the hardware is a crucial element when it comes to augmentation. However, focusing AR selection only on the hardware side limits the potential that could be achieved by the software. Perhaps due to that, all MCDM papers are only focusing on hardware selection criteria (Aydin, 2018; Caricato et al., 2014; Elia et al., 2016). Even though such evaluation is important and beneficial forenterprises, the gap of not considering the software is critical. As the maturity of the hardware is not yet satisfactory, the only way to adopt AR applications early in its life cycle is to focus on correct software selection. The acceptance of the AR solution is based on the approval of the two levels of stakeholders. Those are corporate level and shop floor level. While the corporate level focuses on strategic and financial aspects, the shop floor focuses on ease of use (Brunner et al., 2020). Furthermore, many other challenges need to be considered. The details of AR are explained in section 3.
